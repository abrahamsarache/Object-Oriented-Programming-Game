Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my project.

I am aiming for 'Exceeds expectations' but I will take 'Meets expectations'.

I really enjoyed this one and tried to give it a twist with my illustrations and music(sound effects) that I composed myself for this project.

The Audio.js file contains all my add-ons reffering to that branch, besides I learned how to use 'linear gradients' in CSS. I also changed some of the buttons colors to make them more relatable to my concept.

I created a random gradient background every time you choose a letter. If the letter you choose is correct you get a palette of blue colors in the gradient, otherwise red becomes the protagonist.

I also added a button to play or stop sound effects. 

Thanks again!
